# LiteCode is a lightweight Python stack for accelerated development of applications and services
#
# Though Litecode, "Single" is the new "Full" stack. Using FastAPI and NiceGUI to build
# web applications entirely on the server side, Litecode removes the need for client-side
# JavaScript or TypeScript, while complexity is reduced by using a simplified architecture
# and single language for the entire stack.
