# Litecode

## Introduction

LiteCode is a lightweight Python stack for accelerated development of applications and services.

Though Litecode, "Single" is the new "Full" stack. Using FastAPI and NiceGUI to build 
web applications entirely on the server side, Litecode removes the need for client-side 
JavaScript or TypeScript, while complexity is reduced by using a simplified architecture 
and single language for the entire stack.
